In this final project for Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization, we examine how fertility rates have changed over time in 13 countries and how these trends relate to economic growth, labor-market conditions, migration, and population dynamics. 
Using cross-country time series from 1960–2023, we explore broad global patterns, such as the near-universal decline in fertility, and highlight important country-specific differences through a series of comparative visualizations.
