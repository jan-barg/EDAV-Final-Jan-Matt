# Conclusion
This exploration revealed several broad patterns that held across most of the 13 countries in the dataset: 
Fertility rates have declined everywhere since 1960, while GDP per capita has been rising globally, more or less steadily in more countries.
The relationship between these two variables is consistently negative, even when countries follow different paths.
Nevertheless, none of the other investigated socio-economic factors have proven to be significant predictors of fertility rates. Considering the individual trajectories (i.e., South Korea's rapid economic rise and fertility collapse, or Nigeria's combination of GDP volatility and high fertility), we cannot state that GDP growth is a driving factor when it comes to fertility rates. Rather, the investigation illustrates that the drivers of demographic change are more complicated than any single economic indicator can explain.

There are several caveats to the project when it comes to interpreting the findings:
Firstly, our country set is selective and not representative of the entire world. Extrapolating patterns from these countries to others, especially low-income or politically unstable ones, must be done with caution and consideration. 
Second, many of the indicators come from different (but rather reliable) sources and begin in different years, while some (like FLFPR) have short time spans.
Third, the analysis is only exploratory: although some relationships might look suggestive, and be correlated, none of the observed patterns should be interpreted as causal. For one, even though fertility tends to decline as GDP per capita rises, the paths for South Africa and Nigeria remind us that short term macroeconomic swings do not translate immediately to significant demographic shifts.

There are also limitations to the data we chose, and they constrained what we could do. With net migration being noisy for some countries, and behaving erratically sometimes, we didn't have full historical context for the analyzed countries to know what caused unpredicted spikes. Moreover, fertility and GDP are available on long timescales, but labor metrics begin only in the early 1990s, making long-run comparisons between these impossible. We would have benefited from socio-economic data, such as urbanization rates or education levels, because there are multiple plausible explanations for fertility decline.

Had we had more time or data, there are several directions we would pursue:
- Expanding beyond the 13-country sample to see if the patterns we observe are parts of broader regional clusters.
- Integrating policy variables, such as parental leave, childcare subsidies, or family planning laws
- Investigating more detailed migration data, distinguishing between permanent, temporary, and asylum flows to better understand how migration contributes to population growth in countries below replacement fertility.

During the investigation, we were surprised with how consistent the long-run decline in fertility has been between countries with vastly different locations, cultures, histories, and economic trajectories. We also expected to see clearer relationships between fertility and labor-market variables, but the data showed little uniformity: in some countries, rising female labor force participation rates coincided with falling fertility, while in others, the two moved in the same direction. These inconsistencies showed us an important takeaway: visual patterns appear simple at first, but they often mask complex, country-specific mechanisms underneath.

This project reinforced to us the value and limits of exploratory visualization. We uncovered broad structural patterns and country-level changes that would have been hard to see otherwise, but we were also reminded that demographic change is shaped by multiple factors beyond the economic indicators typically plotted in cross-country charts. 

The questions raised by our graphs suggest multiple paths for deeper analysis, but even at this exploratory stage, the results give a clearer picture of how economic development and population dynamics have evolved together, and diverged, over the past six decades.
