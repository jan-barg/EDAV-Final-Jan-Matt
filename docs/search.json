    "text": "1 Introduction\nGlobally, birth rates have fallen to record lows, raising questions about how economic growth and prosperity shapes population trends. We were drawn to this topic because it sits at the intersection of economics and human behavior, how people’s choices about family size might shift as societies become wealthier, more urban, and more educated. The idea of a “fertility collapse” is more than a simple demographic story; it has deep implications for labor markets, social systems, and long-term economic stability. By looking at how economic growth and fertility rates move together or apart across time and regions, we hope to better understand what drives these changes in population dynamics, and if there are any countries towards which we can look for in hopes of finding a reversal strategy.",

    "text": "2.1 Missing value analysis\nOur data will come from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database. FRED compiles and maintains a wide range of economic and demographic indicators collected by government agencies and international organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and OECD. The data are reported in structured time series format, usually at monthly, quarterly, or annual frequencies depending on the indicator. Each series includes detailed metadata on measurement units, coverage, and source methodology. For our project, we plan to use country-level data on fertility rates and economic growth indicators. One challenge we might face is that the time ranges and reporting frequencies can differ across datasets, which may require some cleaning and alignment before analysis. Since there is no multi-country dataset that covers all the nations we’re interested in, we will write a python script that downloads each investigated country’s data via API and then compiles a master dataset to work with. ## Description",
