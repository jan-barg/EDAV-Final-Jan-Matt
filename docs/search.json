    "text": "1 Introduction\nGlobally, birth rates have fallen to record lows, raising questions about how economic growth and prosperity shapes population trends. We were drawn to this topic because it sits at the intersection of economics and human behavior, how people’s choices about family size might shift as societies become wealthier, more urban, and more educated. The idea of a “fertility collapse” is more than a simple demographic story; it has deep implications for labor markets, social systems, and long-term economic stability. By looking at how economic growth and fertility rates move together or apart across time and regions, we hope to better understand what drives these changes in population dynamics, and if there are any countries towards which we can look for in hopes of finding a reversal strategy.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur data will come from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database. FRED compiles and maintains a wide range of economic and demographic indicators collected by government agencies and international organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and OECD. The data are reported in structured time series format, usually at monthly, quarterly, or annual frequencies depending on the indicator. Each series includes detailed metadata on measurement units, coverage, and source methodology. For our project, we plan to use country-level data on fertility rates and economic growth indicators. One challenge we might face is that the time ranges and reporting frequencies can differ across datasets, which may require some cleaning and alignment before analysis. Since there is no multi-country dataset that covers all the nations we’re interested in, we will write a python script that downloads each investigated country’s data via API and then compiles a master dataset to work with. Here are example datasets for the United States of America that we would use. Many of these are available for multiple countries, hence we would scrape the same datasets, with identical units of measure, for multiple countries.\nFertility Rate — FRED Series This data set is specifically from the World Bank. It is a time series dataset for the fertility rate in the United States as Births Per Woman from 1960 to 2023.\nConstant GDP Per Capita — FRED Series This data set is comes from the World Bank. It is a time series dataset of the GDP per capita for the US from 1960 to 2025.\nEmployment-to-Population Ratio — FRED Series This data set is from the World Bank. It is a time series dataset that shows the employment rate to population ratio as a percentage.\nFemale Labor Force Participation Rate (Ages 15+) — World Bank Indicator This dataset comes from the World Bank, and it measures the percentage of women ages 15 and older who are part of the labor force—that is, women who are either employed or actively seeking employment. It provides insight into female engagement in the economy and helps assess how social, economic, and policy factors influence gender participation in the workforce. The data are reported annually and are available for most countries beginning in 1990.\nGini Index — FRED Series This data comes from the World Bank. The Gini index measures income inequality by calculating the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, where 0 represents perfect equality and 100 represents perfect inequality.\nTotal Population — FRED Series This data, sourced from the World Bank, shows the country’s total population. It might be useful in investigating whether immigration policies compensate for below-replacement birthrates.\nNet Migration — World Bank Indicator This data set comes from the World Bank and measures the net migration rate, defined as the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants for a country over a course of a year. Positive values indicate that more people are entering the country than leaving, while negative values indicate net emigration. This variable is particularly relevant for our analysis, as migration inflows can offset demographic decline caused by falling fertility rates. We also plan to examine possible lag effects between changes in migration and subsequent shifts in population growth.",

Once we evaluate missing data, we aim to address the following questions:\n\nCountry Selection: Which countries provide a holistic overview of birth rates and their correlations with our selected economic and social indicators?\nTimeframe Selection: What timeframe allows us to gain valuable insights without having to impute a significant portion of the data (since heavy imputation could introduce inaccuracies)?\nHandling Missing Data: How should we address missing values while preserving accuracy and comparability to the highest extent possible?\n\nOur plan is to first compile the raw datasets via API (using Python) for each indicator and country, merge them into a master dataset, and then perform exploratory analysis on the combined and cleaned data.",

With this hybrid approach, we can maximize both temporal coverage and analytical depth, enabling broad trend analysis while still leveraging the socio-economic context captured by shorter-range indicators.\nConsidering that almost all variables cover data up to 2023, we decide to cap our exploration at 2023, and stick to the following date ranges for:\n\n1960–2023 for Fertiity Rate, Constant GDP Per Capita, Net Migration, and Total Population\n1991–2023 for Employment-to-Population Ratio, Female Labor Force Participation Rate, and Gini Index",

With &gt;40% missing, these are essentially incomputable and not viable for statistical analysis in combination with the other variables. Thus, we can treat the Gini Index as an extra variable that serves a contextual and interpretive role rather than a primary analytical one. It can be used to illustrate patterns or disparities in income inequality where data is available, but it should not be included in quantitative analyses or cross-variable comparisons due to its inconsistent coverage. One more problem that we can observe in the data missingness table is the fact that 46.9% of the data between 1960 and 2023 is missing for GDP per Capita in Poland. Poland’s GDP data was only reliably reported after 1989, when the communist regime fell in the country. Thus, historical GDP data prior to the early 1990s is often incomplete or unavailable due to differences in accounting standards, data collection methods, and limited integration with international databases such as the World Bank. Therefore, for Poland, we will retain this gap rather than imputing values to preserve data consistency across sources.\n\n\nCode\ngini_start &lt;- 1991L\ngini_end   &lt;- 2023L\n\ngini_countries &lt;- range_filtered_data |&gt;\n  filter(variable == \"gini_index\") |&gt;\n  distinct(country)\n\ngini_grid &lt;- gini_countries |&gt;\n  crossing(year = gini_start:gini_end)\n\ngini_long &lt;- gini_grid |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    range_filtered_data |&gt;\n      filter(variable == \"gini_index\") |&gt;\n      transmute(country, year, value = as.numeric(value)),\n    by = c(\"country\", \"year\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(present = ifelse(is.finite(value) & !is.na(value), \"Present\", \"Missing\"))\n\ngini_order &lt;- gini_long |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  summarise(pct_missing = mean(present == \"Missing\"), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(pct_missing))\n\ngini_long &lt;- gini_long |&gt;\n  mutate(country = factor(country, levels = gini_order$country))\n\nggplot(gini_long, aes(x = year, y = country, fill = present)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.15) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(gini_start, gini_end, by = 4)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(Missing = \"grey85\", Present = \"steelblue\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Gini Index availability by country and year\",\n    subtitle = \"Window: 1991–2023 (blue = data present, gray = missing)\",\n    x = \"Year\", y = \"Country\", fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a folder for processed data if it doesn’t exist\nif (!dir.exists(\"./data-gathering/data/processed\")) {\n  dir.create(\"./data-gathering/data/processed\", recursive = TRUE)\n}\n\n# Save the cleaned, filtered dataset\nwrite_csv(range_filtered_data, \"./data-gathering/data/processed/range_filtered_data.csv\")\n\n# also save RDS\nsaveRDS(range_filtered_data, \"./data-gathering/data/processed/range_filtered_data.rds\")",

While the change varies across the countries, it is interesting to see that all countries except Japan had fertility levels above the replacement rate - and only Nigeria and South Africa (barely!) managed to sustain fertility levels above 2.1 births per woman. The pattern is strikingly similar for Germany, Japan, Sweden, and Poland, which were just around replacement level 65 years ago, and have fallen much below it ever since. The decline in fertility is quicker in the US and Australia, and even more so across the first 5 countries in the figure above. Out of these, China marks an interesting case: it is the only country that exhibited significant positive growth in fertility rates throughout the 60+ year period. This could stem from several reasons, but the most likely cause seems to be the end of the 1959-1961 Great Chinese Famine. After living conditions stabilized in the country, the citizens were more likely to decide to have children. Because China had not yet implemented fertility-control policies, this rebound appears prominently in the data.\n\n\n3.1.2 Fertility rate heat map\n\n\nCode\n# compute average fertility over the entire period\n\nfertility_data &lt;- fertility_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    country_name = factor(country_name, levels = rev(country_order))\n  )\n\nggplot(fertility_data, aes(x = year, y = country_name, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    \"Year\",\n    breaks = seq(1960, 2020, by = 10),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0))\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Births per\\nwoman\",\n    option = \"magma\",\n    direction = -1\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y  = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title   = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fertility is converging across countries over time\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility rates across countries and years, with countries ordered by average fertility.\n\n\n\n\nIn the fertility heat map, we see patterns that converge towards lower fertility, with some interruptions of darker shades. Most notably, Nigeria, which exhibits by far the highest fertility of the 13 countries, is seeing a decline in its fertility. On the other hand, South Korea has been seeing the lowest rates of child birth since the start of the millennium.",

The United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Germany, and Japan all show steady and sustained income growth over the entire period. South Korea stands out as the strongest “growth miracle,” rising from extremely low income levels in 1960 to high-income status by 2020. Middle-income countries such as Brazil and South Africa show more uneven patterns: periods of growth followed by stagnation or declines, reflecting political and economic instability. Nigeria’s GDP per capita is highly volatile, with several swings, likely caused by oil price cycles and structural instability within the country. Nevertheless, each country has much higher GDP per capita in 2023 than in 1960.\nNOTE: We tried to group countries into three GDP tiers and give each tier its own y-scale using ggh4x. Although the method should work in theory, it produced layout glitches (empty panels, misaligned strips, overlapping axes) in our setup. After several failed fixes, we reverted to a simpler, reliable approach: a standard facet plot with countries ordered by median GDP.\n\n\n3.2.2 Fertility vs GDP per capita\n\n\nCode\n#| label: fert-gdp-facets\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between fertility and GDP per capita, one panel per country.\"\n\nfert_gdp &lt;- master_long |&gt;\n  filter(\n    variable %in% c(\"fertility_rate\", \"gdp_capita_const\"),\n    year &gt;= 1960,\n    year &lt;= end_year\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(country, year, variable, value) |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) |&gt;\n  left_join(country_lookup, by = \"country\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(fertility_rate), !is.na(gdp_capita_const))\n\nggplot(fert_gdp, aes(x = gdp_capita_const, y = fertility_rate)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = \"#2c7fb8\", size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.7, color = \"#d95f02\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ country_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(\n    \"Constant GDP per capita (log scale)\",\n    labels = scales::label_number(scale_cut = scales::cut_si(\"\"))\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Fertility rate (births per woman)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fertility declines as GDP per capita rises\",\n    subtitle = \"Each panel shows a country's trajectory across 1960–2023\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting Fertility Rates vs GDP per capita, we see constant decline for most countries. This does not necessarily imply causation, as shown by South Africa and Nigeria: the two countries that experienced high volatility exhibit high irregularity in the plotted patterns, showing that quick significant changes in GDP per capita do not go together with similarly swift changes in fertility rates.\n\n\nCode\n# #| label: gapminder-fertility-gdp\n# #| eval: true\n# #| message: false\n# #| warning: false\n# \n# library(gganimate)\n# library(gifski)\n# library(dplyr)\n# \n# gapminder_data &lt;- master_long |&gt;\n#   filter(\n#     variable %in% c(\"fertility_rate\", \"gdp_capita_const\", \"total_population\"),\n#     year &gt;= 1960,\n#     year &lt;= end_year\n#   ) |&gt;\n#   select(country, year, variable, value) |&gt;\n#   tidyr::pivot_wider(\n#     names_from  = variable,\n#     values_from = value\n#   ) |&gt;\n#   left_join(country_lookup, by = \"country\") |&gt;\n#   # keep rows with both fertility & GDP present\n#   filter(!is.na(fertility_rate), !is.na(gdp_capita_const))\n# \n# # pull out Nigeria rows (might be 0 if data is missing!)\n# nigeria_data &lt;- gapminder_data |&gt;\n#   filter(country == \"Nigeria\")\n# \n# # base plot\n# p_gapminder &lt;- ggplot(\n#   gapminder_data,\n#   aes(\n#     x     = gdp_capita_const,\n#     y     = fertility_rate,\n#     size  = total_population / 1e6,   # millions\n#     color = region,\n#     group = country\n#   )\n# ) +\n#   geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n#   scale_x_log10(\n#     \"Constant GDP per capita (log scale)\",\n#     labels = scales::label_number(scale_cut = scales::cut_si(\"\"))\n#   ) +\n#   scale_y_continuous(\n#     \"Fertility rate (births per woman)\",\n#     limits = c(0, NA)\n#   ) +\n#   scale_size_continuous(\n#     name  = \"Population (millions)\",\n#     range = c(2, 10),\n#     guide = \"legend\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n#   theme(\n#     legend.position = \"right\",\n#     plot.title      = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n#     plot.subtitle   = element_text(size = 11)\n#   ) +\n#   labs(\n#     title    = \"Fertility vs GDP per Capita Over Time\",\n#     subtitle = \"Year: {frame_time}\",\n#     color    = \"Region\"\n#   )\n# \n# # only add highlight + label if Nigeria actually has data\n# if (nrow(nigeria_data) &gt; 0) {\n#   p_gapminder &lt;- p_gapminder +\n#     geom_point(\n#       data  = nigeria_data,\n#       aes(\n#         x     = gdp_capita_const,\n#         y     = fertility_rate,\n#         size  = total_population / 1e6,\n#         group = country\n#       ),\n#       inherit.aes = FALSE,\n#       shape = 21,\n#       fill  = \"gold\",\n#       color = \"black\",\n#       stroke = 1.1,\n#       alpha  = 0.95,\n#       show.legend = FALSE\n#     ) +\n#     geom_text(\n#       data  = nigeria_data,\n#       aes(\n#         x     = gdp_capita_const,\n#         y     = fertility_rate,\n#         label = \"Nigeria\",\n#         group = country\n#       ),\n#       inherit.aes = FALSE,\n#       vjust = -1,\n#       fontface = \"bold\",\n#       show.legend = FALSE\n#     )\n# }\n# \n# p_gapminder &lt;- p_gapminder +\n#   transition_time(year) +\n#   ease_aes(\"linear\")\n# \n# # animate and save as GIF\n# anim &lt;- animate(\n#   p_gapminder,\n#   renderer = gifski_renderer(),\n#   width    = 800,\n#   height   = 600,\n#   res      = 120,\n#   fps      = 10,\n#   duration = 12\n# )\n# \n# if (!dir.exists(\"figs\")) dir.create(\"figs\")\n# anim_save(\"figs/gapminder_fertility_gdp.gif\", animation = anim)\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Yearly snapshots of GDP per capita, population, and fertility\n In this animated graph, one can track changes in fertility, GDP per capita, and population over time. Each frame represents one year between 1960 and 2023, and each dot represents one country. As the dot’s size grows, so does the country’s population. As it moves to the right, its GDP per capita rises, and as it moves down, its fertility decreases. For example, the brown dot that jumps up and down at the beginning, then sharply falls towards the bottom is China - as the animations reflects its quick changes in fertility described above. Most countries, particularly European and North American, seem to gravitate towards the bottom right corner (high GDP per capita and low fertility). They also, at least at the start of the animation, grow in size, indicating increasing population. As mentioned above, Nigeria (red dot at the top) stands as the clearest exception.\n\n\n3.2.4 Fertility vs female labor force participation\n\n\nCode\nfert_flfpr &lt;- master_long |&gt;\n  filter(\n    variable %in% c(\"fertility_rate\", \"flfpr\"),\n    year &gt;= 1990,              # FLFPR starts around 1990\n    year &lt;= end_year\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(country, year, variable, value) |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) |&gt;\n  left_join(country_lookup, by = \"country\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(fertility_rate), !is.na(flfpr))\n\nggplot(\n  fert_flfpr,\n  aes(\n    x      = flfpr,\n    y      = fertility_rate,\n    group  = country_name\n  )\n) +\n  geom_path(aes(color = year), linewidth = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Year\",\n    option = \"plasma\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ country_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Female labor force participation rate (%)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Fertility rate (births per woman)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text   = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title   = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Fertility and female labor force participation\",\n    subtitle = \"Each panel shows a country's trajectory since 1990, with color indicating year\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between fertility and female labor force participation, with time evolution shown by connected points.\n\n\n\n\nWhen investigating fertility rates against female labor force participation rates (some speculate women tend to give less births the more they work), we cannot see any clear pattern.

In low-migration societies, migration is too small to affect total population change.\nThese plots combine levels with growth rates — this induces spurious correlations This is the subtle but important statistical issue. Migration is: net_migration(t) Population growth is: (pop(t+1) – pop(t)) / pop(t) Population(t) has long, slow-moving inertia. Migration(t) is short-term and noisy.",
