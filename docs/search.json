    "text": "1 Introduction\nGlobally, birth rates have fallen to record lows, raising questions about how economic growth and prosperity shapes population trends. We were drawn to this topic because it sits at the intersection of economics and human behavior, how people’s choices about family size might shift as societies become wealthier, more urban, and more educated. The idea of a “fertility collapse” is more than a simple demographic story; it has deep implications for labor markets, social systems, and long-term economic stability. By looking at how economic growth and fertility rates move together or apart across time and regions, we hope to better understand what drives these changes in population dynamics, and if there are any countries towards which we can look for in hopes of finding a reversal strategy.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur data will come from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database. FRED compiles and maintains a wide range of economic and demographic indicators collected by government agencies and international organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and OECD. The data are reported in structured time series format, usually at monthly, quarterly, or annual frequencies depending on the indicator. Each series includes detailed metadata on measurement units, coverage, and source methodology. For our project, we plan to use country-level data on fertility rates and economic growth indicators. One challenge we might face is that the time ranges and reporting frequencies can differ across datasets, which may require some cleaning and alignment before analysis. Since there is no multi-country dataset that covers all the nations we’re interested in, we will write a python script that downloads each investigated country’s data via API and then compiles a master dataset to work with. Here are example datasets for the United States of America that we would use. Many of these are available for multiple countries, hence we would scrape the same datasets, with identical units of measure, for multiple countries.\nFertility Rate — FRED Series\nThis data set is specifically from the World Bank. It is a time series dataset for the fertility rate in the United States as Births Per Woman from 1960 to 2023.\nConstant GDP Per Capita — FRED Series\nThis data set is comes from the World Bank. It is a time series dataset of the GDP per capita for the US from 1960 to 2025.\nEmployment-to-Population Ratio — FRED Series\nThis data set is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is a time series dataset that shows the employment rate to population ratio as a percentage.\nInactivity Rate Female: Ages 15–64 — FRED Series\nThis data comes from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and it is a time series dataset that shows the inactivity rate (defined as the proportion of the population that is not working and not actively looking for a job) of females aged 15–64 as a percentage.\nGini Index — FRED Series\nThis data comes from the World Bank. The Gini index measures income inequality by calculating the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, where 0 represents perfect equality and 100 represents perfect inequality.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nFor the data collection, we will scrape data for selected countries and then assess data completeness, as the datasets vary in their time scope from country to country. Once we evaluate missing data, we aim to address the following questions:\n\nTimeframe Selection:\nWhat timeframe allows us to gain valuable insights without having to impute a significant portion of the data (since heavy imputation could introduce inaccuracies)?\nCountry Selection:\nWhich countries provide a holistic overview of birth rates and their correlations with our selected economic and social indicators?\nHandling Missing Data:\nHow should we address missing values while preserving accuracy and comparability to the highest extent possible?\n\nOur plan is to first compile the raw datasets via API (using Python) for each indicator and country, merge them into a master dataset, and then perform exploratory analysis on the combined and cleaned data.",
