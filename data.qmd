# Data
Our data will come from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database. FRED compiles and maintains a wide range of economic and demographic indicators collected by government agencies and international organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and OECD. The data are reported in structured time series format, usually at monthly, quarterly, or annual frequencies depending on the indicator. Each series includes detailed metadata on measurement units, coverage, and source methodology. For our project, we plan to use country-level data on fertility rates and economic growth indicators. One challenge we might face is that the time ranges and reporting frequencies can differ across datasets, which may require some cleaning and alignment before analysis. Since there is no multi-country dataset that covers all the nations we’re interested in, we will write a python script that downloads each investigated country’s data via API and then compiles a master dataset to work with.
